# bidrag-actions/prepare-release-mvn-pkg

This action will prepare a maven artifact to be released. It will get the
release version from the expected SNAPSHOT version of the project. This
version will be bumped, ie. the pom.xml will be modified.

Requires a github runner with maven and a github artifact being built
with maven and runs on an environment which support bash-scripts.

No inputs are required but the action will output the tagged-release and
the commit-sha, see `action.yml`.
